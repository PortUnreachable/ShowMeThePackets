That horizontal line is the very first result of a Taylor series with one term.

If you scan down to the result of using six terms, the values very closely approximate *sin(x)* for a much wider range, nearly *-5.0* to *5.0*.  There are some diminishing returns, however.

Why is it stored this way?  Because it makes it very easy to take new reviews and automatically convert them into this same format.  This would allow us to take our trained network and very quickly process new reviews to determine if they are negative reviews (a label value of 0) or positive reviews (a label value of 1).\n",
